#Pokeclicker Helpers

Pokeclicker (https://ishadijcks.github.io/) is an incremental/idle browser game based on the Pokemon franchise.
This repository contains a collection of helpful scripts to automate certain aspects of the game, including breeding
and hatching eggs, completing a gym multiple times (useful for quests and shards), and automatically running dungeons.

Most of these scripts have only been tested late-game where money/tokens are not an issue, all egg slots unlocked,
and with access to all areas of the game. There may be unexpected bugs to hunt down and catch.

##To-Do
- [ ] read and complete quests automatically
- [ ] more intelligent dungeon completion
- [ ] automatic playthrough from start
