# Pokeclicker Helpers

Pokeclicker (https://www.pokeclicker.com/) is an incremental/idle browser game based on the Pokemon franchise.
This repository contains a collection of helpful scripts to automate certain aspects of the game, including breeding
and hatching eggs, completing a gym multiple times (useful for quests and shards), and automatically running dungeons.

Most of these scripts have only been tested late-game where money/tokens are not an issue, all egg slots unlocked,
and with access to all areas of the game. There may be unexpected bugs to hunt down and catch.

## Usage
- Hatching Eggs
  - In console, load js and run loopEggs()
  - you may sort Pokemon List to determine hatching priority
  - you may set filters in Hatchery List to add constraints to hatching pokemons 
- Looping Gym
  - In console, load js 
  - run loopGym(gymName, times)
  - run loopGym("", times) for the gym of current town
